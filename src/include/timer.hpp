//  A timer object measures elapsed time.
//  It is recommended that implementations measure wall clock rather than CPU
//  time since the intended use is performance measurement on systems where
//  total elapsed time is more important than just process or CPU time.
//  Warnings: The maximum measurable elapsed time may well be only 596.5+ hours
//  due to implementation limitations.  The accuracy of timings depends on the
//  accuracy of timing information provided by the underlying platform, and
//  this varies a great deal from platform to platform.

 * This class contains of a Timer based on system clock. It follows the same
 * interface of Boost::Timer, but it measures the real time. Resolution in
 * seconds.
